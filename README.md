Website for Revolution Chinese Yoyo
A responsive website I created for Revolution, the Chinese Yoyo team at the University of Michigan. 
Featuring pictures, information, and a contact form that sends a email to Revolution, powered by Formspree. 
Prototyped in Adobe XD and coded in Brackets with HTML/CSS.
